# Thomas The Turtle

Help Thomas prepare for his upcoming race by leveling up his speed rating to 5!

-Thomas has five ratings that the user can manipulate throughout the game: Thirst, Hunger,
Fatigue, Speed, and Happiness.

-The user will be prompted with a set of instructions (1-6) that will show them the various options
they have to interact with Thomas. If the user does not want to continue playing, they have the option
of exiting the game by pressing "6".

-Every time you give food or water to Thomas, his hunger or thirst rating 
will increase by one. 

-Every time you have Thomas run sprints, his speed rating will increase by one. Simultaneously, 
after each sprint, his fatigue rating will also increase by two.

-If at any point Thomas' fatigue rating gets out of hand, which will happen after he runs sprints
each time, have him go to bed so that he can recover. This will cause his hunger, thirst, fatigue,
and happiness ratings to be reset to zero, but his speed rating will always stay set to its current value
at that moment in time.

-Once Thomas' speed rating reaches 5 the game is over. He is ready for his
upcoming race!

-If you decide to no longer help Thomas prepare for his race the application will end with a few
closing print statements, including the current speed rating that Thomas reached before the application
ended.
